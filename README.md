# cryptit

One of the early C / C++ programs I wrote. Highly inefficient and sometime stupid.
For historical and archiving purposes.
Do not read the codes and definitely do not use these codes.

If you still want to read or use it, don't blame me if anything goes wrong, and things will go wrong.

*If you read the code*

* Your blender will be sentient.
* You cat will be pregnant of your future dog.
* You goldfish will no longer float.

*If you use the program*

* You will be marked as target by the International Weather Control Organisation, Population Control Enforcement Division
* You will no longer be allowed to ride a bicycle.

*If you reuse the code*

* You will be marked as target by the Confederation of World Enigma and Antikythera Master Architects Joint Counter Strike Force.
* Your IQ will be reduced to 86
* Shrek will come and put you in the dungeon


Seriously, do not go beyond this page.
